Updates:
- change-block-color action, takes a ^color string (red, green, blue, white, or off) and the id of the cube to change (its object ID)
- when remembering a block, you need to add a NEW attribute not on the input-link: color. You have to manually update this every time you change the color. 
- light cube objects have a "last-tapped" attribute on the input-link which says when it was last tapped. This needds to be in the remember operator now
- object config files
- All objects now have type based on their object config type
- Light cube type is now "led-cube"
- Go-to-object now takes distance parameter
- Go-to-object only works for LightCubes
